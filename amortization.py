# How to calculate Loan Amortization Schedule with python
# Author Isaac Kakodwa--------------ikpixels.py@gmail.com

"""Amortization schedule â€“ table, containing the following
   Payments, interest paid, principal paid and outstanding
   principal columns.
    
   Example:Suppose that you take out a MK 250,000 house mortgage
   from your local savings bank.The bank requires you to repay
   the mortgage in equal annual installments over the next 30
   years.It must therefore set the annual payments so that they
   have a present value of MK 250,000"""
